# hello-world
First project, for learning purposes.
I'm trying to learn how to code so I can create a short thriller game. 
This is very ambitious for me since I have never coded anything in my life before and I have so many other things going on, such as music, fasion design, physical fitness, and family needs (all should be focused on), not even mentioning school. 
I would hate to drop everything else I already have going for me for this, I wish I could keep my interests in check and keep a solid schedule for everything I want to do, but to be honest, life is stressing me out right now and I wish things were easier.
